# Dynamic Method Serializer

> A C# code snippet that enables dynamic method invocation through serializable expressions.

## Overview

This code example allows capturing C# method calls as serializable DTOs that can be stored or transmitted, then executed later. It works by deconstructing lambda expressions into a JSON format containing the interface type, method name, and parameters.

## Features

- ‚ú® Serialize method calls to JSON
- üîÑ Support both void and value-returning methods
- üì¶ Handle array parameters
- üè≠ Extensible factory pattern for implementations
- üîç Type-safe execution

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DynamicMethodSerializer.git
cd DynamicMethodSerializer
dotnet build
```

## Usage

Basic example:

```csharp
// Execute method with return value
var result = DynamicExecutor.Execute<IExample, int>(x => x.Add(5, 3));

// Execute void method
DynamicExecutor.Execute<IExample>(x => x.Print(\"Hello, World!\"));
```

Serialized output:

```json
{
  \"interfaceType\": \"IExample\",
  \"methodName\": \"Add\",
  \"arguments\": [
    {
      \"typeName\": \"System.Int32\",
      \"value\": 5
    },
    {
      \"typeName\": \"System.Int32\", 
      \"value\": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

## How It Works

1. Expression tree deconstruction
2. Serialization to DTO format
3. JSON serialization/deserialization
4. Dynamic method invocation via reflection
